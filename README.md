# Introduction : 

  **IPCop** is an open-source Linux distribution designed to be used as a network firewall. It is based on the Linux *Netfilter/IPtables* framework and provides a user-friendly web interface for firewall configuration and management. **IPCop** is often used in small and medium-sized businesses as well as home networks to protect local networks from external threats.

The primary role of **IPCop** is to control the flow of incoming and outgoing data in the network by applying specific security rules. It allows for defining restrictions and access policies to prevent attacks from the internet, restrict access to certain services or websites, and safeguard sensitive data from intrusions.
