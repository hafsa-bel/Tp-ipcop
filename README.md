# Introduction : 

  **IPCop** is an open-source Linux distribution designed to be used as a network firewall. It is based on the Linux *Netfilter/IPtables* framework and provides a user-friendly web interface for firewall configuration and management. **IPCop** is often used in small and medium-sized businesses as well as home networks to protect local networks from external threats.

The primary role of **IPCop** is to control the flow of incoming and outgoing data in the network by applying specific security rules. It allows for defining restrictions and access policies to prevent attacks from the internet, restrict access to certain services or websites, and safeguard sensitive data from intrusions.

# IPCOP'S installation :

## Web Proxy :

In **IPCop**, a web proxy refers to a component or feature that acts as an intermediary between clients (such as web browsers) and web servers. It facilitates the retrieval of web content by clients by caching and managing web requests and responses.

The initial line within the Settings box indicates the current status of the proxy server, indicating whether it is currently stopped or running.

## URL Filtering:

The **URL filter** in IPCop enhances its capabilities by allowing the blocking of unwanted domains, URLs, and files. This feature utilizes the widely recognized squidGuard redirector. The graphical user interface of the URL filter provides access to all necessary settings, including squidGuard-compatible blacklists, as well as constraints based on time, category, and clients.

The initial line within the Settings box indicates the current status of the filter service, indicating whether it is currently stopped or running.
