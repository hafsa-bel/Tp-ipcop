# Introduction : 

  **IPCop** is an open-source Linux distribution designed to be used as a network firewall. It is based on the Linux *Netfilter/IPtables* framework and provides a user-friendly web interface for firewall configuration and management. **IPCop** is often used in small and medium-sized businesses as well as home networks to protect local networks from external threats.
